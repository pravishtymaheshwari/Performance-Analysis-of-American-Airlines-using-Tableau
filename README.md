# Performance-Analysis-of-American-Airlines-using-Tableau


The dataset is taken from The Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) website which stores monthly information about airline on-time flight performance. The detailed flight data provides information about total flights, cancelled flights, delay types, delay causes, cancellations,etc. In this project, the analysis is done for the year 2021. 
The data cleaning is done using RStudio, concatening 12 csv files into 1 file containing information of flights and their origin and destination airport, departure and arrival statistics, cause of delays, etc. Tableau dashboards were created to compare the performance of American Airlines with other airlines based on different metrics and identify its competitor airline and provided suggestions to improve performance.

Find below the link to Tableau Story that I created to further to visualize the insights and trends derived from this analysis.https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/pravishty.maheshwari8620/viz/PerformanceAnalysisofAmericanAirlines/Story1
